# How does Helix work?

This page takes a behind-the-scenes look at the overall Helix architecture and describes its main components.

Helix uses the Fastly CDN to deliver content and deploys Helix-specific _VCL edge code_ to process client requests.

That VCL code is generated by the _hlx publish_ command along with the _Helix Publish Service_ deployed in Adobe I/O Runtime.
Together, they generate and setup the appropriate Fastly configurations based on the contents
of the source GitHub repository which provides the content, rendering templates and code as well as the 
Helix configuration file.

The _hlx deploy_ command is used to deploy the rendering code in Adobe I/O Runtime, based on the rendering templates and code
supplied in the GitHub source repository.

Updates to these components are atomic, and the Helix Strains let users define staged variants of their content, to have
full control on the publishing process and allow for intermediate reviews before publishing content.
